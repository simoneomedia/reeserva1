# Reeserva Booking Suite (base)

This is a minimal plugin skeleton wired to GitHub updates.
- Install this ZIP in WordPress.
- Push a GitHub **Release** with a tag higher than the `Version` in `reeserva-booking-suite.php` (e.g. `v1.0.1`).
- WordPress will offer an autoâ€‘update.

## Development
If this repo is part of a monorepo, keep the plugin in a dedicated folder and zip only that folder for Releases.
